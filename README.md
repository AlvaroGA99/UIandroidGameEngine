# UIandroidGameEngine

Game engine mobile app prototype that adapt workflows and concepts of modern and popular game engines into a user friendly mobile app, that allows users to publish and play 2D microgames.

The engine uses a object-components architecture with predefined elements and UI layouts similar to most used game engines, but simplified and adapted for a mobile interface and experience. The engine uses Firebase Realtime Database to allow users to see a listing of published games and give them a try.


The following link features a video with a preview of the app.
